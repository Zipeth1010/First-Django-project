# First-Django-project

When opening the repository, ensure that pip is installed using the command on the commandline: \n python3.11 -m ensurepip \n
After this is complete, install Django by using the command: \n python3.11 -m pip install Django \n
To run the application, there are a couple more steps. One must make the migrations from manage.py by running the command: \n python3.11 manage.py makemigrations \n
After this is done, run the following command: \n python3.11 manage.py migrate \n
Finally, do the following command to run the server locally on port 8000: \n python3.11 manage.py runserver \n
Open a Google Chrome browser and go to the address: 'localhost:8000' to see the application working!
