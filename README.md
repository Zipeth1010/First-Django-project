# First-Django-project

After cloning the repository, ensure that pip is installed using the command on the commandline: <br/> python3.11 -m ensurepip <br/>
After this is complete, install Django by using the command: <br/> python3.11 -m pip install Django <br/>
To run the application, there are a couple more steps. One must make the migrations from manage.py by running the command: <br/> python3.11 manage.py makemigrations <br/>
After this is done, run the following command: <br/> python3.11 manage.py migrate <br/>
Finally, do the following command to run the server locally on port 8000: <br/> python3.11 manage.py runserver <br/>
Open a Google Chrome browser and go to the address: 'localhost:8000' to see the application working!
